# CodeGuess Hangman

This Hangman game was developed to provide a fun and educational experience, helping players improve their word-guessing skills and expand their knowledge of programming terms.

This game allows users to guess programming-related words one letter at a time, with hints provided after incorrect guesses. The goal is to guess the word before running out of attempts.

The game is ideal for programming students, developers, and tech enthusiasts looking to test their knowledge in an engaging and interactive manner.

## Features
### Current Features

- __Random Word Selection:__ The game selects a random word with a hint from a predefined list, ensuring variety in each new game.

- __Display Guessed Letters:__ Shows the current state of the word with guessed letters and underscores for unguessed letters, allowing the player to track their progress.

- __Hints:__ Provides a hint after an incorrect guess, increasing the player's chances of success.

- __Input Validation:__ Ensures that only valid alphabetic characters are accepted as guesses, preventing invalid and duplicate entries.

### Future Features

- __Word Categories:__ Add different categories for word selection, allowing players to choose specific themes like "Programming Languages," "Development Tools," etc.
  
- __Difficulty Levels:__ Implement difficulty levels such as easy, medium, and hard to challenge players according to their skills.
  
- __Multiplayer Mode:__ Enable two or more players to play together, making the game more social and competitive.

## Data Model

The game utilizes a simple yet effective data model:

- __List of Words and Hints:__ A list of tuples where each tuple contains a word and its corresponding hint.

- __Set of Guessed Letters:__ A set to store letters that have been correctly guessed by the player, facilitating the checking and updating of the word's state.

- __Remaining Attempts:__ A counter for the remaining attempts before the game ends, providing a limit to the number of errors the player can make.

## Testing

The project has been rigorously tested to ensure a smooth gameplay experience with no bugs:

### Testing Methodology

- __Cross-Platform Execution:__ The game has been tested on different operating systems such as Windows, macOS, and Linux to ensure compatibility.

- __Input Validation:__ I tested valid inputs (alphabetic letters) and invalid inputs (numbers, symbols, multiple letters) to ensure the game responds correctly.

- __Hint Display:__ I verified that hints are displayed correctly after incorrect guesses, helping the player to guess the word.

- __End Game Messages:__ I confirmed that the game ends correctly with a victory or defeat message, depending on the player's performance.

## Bugs 

### solved Bugs 

- __Guess Validation:__ Fixed an issue where non-alphabetic characters were accepted as guesses.

- __End Game Messages:__ Resolved a bug where the game did not correctly display victory/defeat messages.

### Remaining Bugs

- __No Known Bugs:__ Currently, there are no known bugs in the game.
